# DL-NLP_Sarcasm
Detecting sarcasm in article headlines

Natural Language Processing (or NLP) can be used to analyze or generate texts. This can be useful for many reasons, like creating a chatbot to automate answers to customers questions, or perform sentiment analysis on clients reviews.
Today we will build a simple neural network to perfom classification, in order to detect sarcasm in news headlines. The aim of the project was to discover NLP by practice, already having some kind of knowledge in Neural Networks.  
This project is using a dataset found on Kaggle, as usual: "News Headlines Dataset For Sarcasm Detection".  

For this project we will follow multiple steps :  

First import the necessary librairies  
Load and explore the dataset  
Preprocess the data  
Represent the text data with Word2Vec  
Build a Neural Network model  
Test the model  
The dataset we will use is, as usual, from Kaggle. Many people have tried to perform similar projects on this dataset, so I hope it works fine!
